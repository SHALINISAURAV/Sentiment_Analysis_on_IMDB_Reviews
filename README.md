# 🎬 Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews

This project demonstrates **Sentiment Analysis** using the [IMDB Movie Reviews dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).  
We build a Deep Learning model with **Word Embeddings** and **LSTM networks** to classify reviews as **positive** or **negative**.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal**: Predict the sentiment (Positive/Negative) of a movie review.  
- **Dataset**: IMDB Reviews (50,000 labeled movie reviews).  
- **Approach**:  
  - Data preprocessing (tokenization, padding).  
  - Word embeddings for text representation.  
  - LSTM model for sequence learning.  
  - Evaluation using accuracy & loss metrics.
